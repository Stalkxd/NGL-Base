# NGL Base

An NPC base for Garry's Mod built for large battles (100+ NPCs) with minimal server CPU load, in singleplayer and multiplayer, across gamemodes.

## Roadmap

1. **Benchmark harness and entity choice** (this step). A tool that spawns N NPCs and measures server CPU per tick, used to compare an engine NextBot with a lightweight custom entity. Every later step is measured with it.
2. **NPC base core.** One central scheduler with a CPU budget per tick, distance-based update rates (LOD), a spatial grid for perception, and an authoring API (states, relationships, damage, weapons).
3. **Custom navigation.** Our own lightweight nav graph generated per map (no navmesh, no AI nodes), path-finding spread over several ticks, and shared paths / flow fields for groups.
4. **Battle test.** Two teams of 100+ soldiers on several maps, singleplayer and dedicated server, tuned against the target.

**Target:** 100 NPCs fighting with minimal server CPU load. Step 1 gives us the baseline numbers to turn this into a hard ms-per-tick figure.

## Installing

Copy (or clone) this folder into `garrysmod/addons/ngl-base`, then restart the map.

## Running the benchmark

Commands need superadmin (the host in singleplayer) or the server console. Look at an open flat area first, since NPCs spawn where you aim. `gm_flatgrass` or `gm_construct` work well.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ngl_bench <class> <count>` | One run, e.g. `ngl_bench ngl_bench_light 100` |
| `ngl_bench_compare [count]` | Light entity vs NextBot vs `npc_combine_s` at the same count (default 100) |
| `ngl_bench_sweep <class> <c1,c2,...>` | Several counts in a row, e.g. `ngl_bench_sweep ngl_bench_light 25,50,100,200` |
| `ngl_bench_limit [class\|all] [start]` | Stress test: climbs 100, 200, 300 ... 2000 NPCs until more than 1% of ticks are late, and prints the highest count that held. `all` (default) does light, NextBot and Combine |
| `ngl_bench_stop` | Abort and remove everything |
| `ngl_bench_clear` | Remove benchmark NPCs |

Each run samples the empty server, spawns the NPCs in two facing teams, waits for warmup, then samples while they chase, strafe and shoot. The report shows:

- **Server frame, empty / loaded**: the engine's own server frame time, which includes engine AI, physics, networking and Lua. `engine.ServerFrameTime()` is client-only, so the client that ran the command (or the first player, for console runs) samples the value net_graph shows and reports it back. A dedicated-server run from the server console with nobody connected only gets Lua time.
- **Added by NPCs**: loaded minus empty, per tick and per NPC, and the share of the tick budget used.
- **Bench AI Lua only**: time spent in our own Lua for the two test entities.
- **Late ticks, empty / loaded**: ticks that arrived more than 1.5x the tick interval late. Compare the two: in singleplayer, late ticks often come from a low client FPS rather than the NPCs.
- **Client FPS**: the reporting client's framerate during the loaded phase.

Results are also saved as JSON in `garrysmod/data/ngl_bench/`.

### Settings

| ConVar | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ngl_bench_baseline` | 5 | Seconds of empty sampling |
| `ngl_bench_warmup` | 5 | Seconds after spawning before sampling |
| `ngl_bench_duration` | 20 | Seconds of loaded sampling |
| `ngl_bench_gap` | 1600 | Distance between the teams at spawn |
| `ngl_bench_spacing` | 60 | Spacing inside a team |
| `ngl_bench_god` | 1 | Huge health, so the NPC count stays constant |
| `ngl_bench_bullets` | 0 | 1 = real `FireBullets` with tracers, 0 = one trace per shot |
| `ngl_bench_keep` | 0 | Keep NPCs after the run |
| `ngl_bench_weapon` | weapon_smg1 | Weapon for engine `npc_*` classes |

### The two test entities

Both run the same decision code (`lua/ngl/server/sv_bench_ai.lua`), so the comparison is about the foundation, not the AI.

- `ngl_bench_nextbot`: stock NextBot with engine locomotion and animation. It moves with `loco:Approach` and no path-finding, so a real path-finding NextBot costs more.
- `ngl_bench_light`: `base_anim` entity with no per-entity Think. One `Tick` hook drives all of them, movement is `SetPos` plus one ground trace, collision is a bounding box, and animation plays on the client.

### Getting trustworthy numbers

On singleplayer or a listen server the "server frame" is really the whole game frame, including rendering, so only the Lua line means anything there. The harness prints a warning in that case, and also when the game window lost focus (GMod sleeps 50 ms per frame in the background).

For real numbers, run a local dedicated server on the same PC:

1. Download [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD), then at its prompt run `force_install_dir C:\gmodserver`, `login anonymous`, `app_update 4020 validate`.
2. Copy this addon into its `garrysmod/addons/` folder.
3. Start it with a `start.bat` in that folder containing `srcds.exe -console -game garrysmod +map gm_flatgrass +maxplayers 2` (`srcds_win64.exe` if your game is on the x86-64 branch, `srcds_run` on Linux). Without `-console` you get a GUI window whose console is on the "Console" tab.
4. Join it from your game with `connect localhost`.
5. Type commands in the **server console window**. NPCs spawn where the first player is looking, so stand somewhere open; gm_flatgrass fits the big counts.

On a dedicated server the frame time reported by net_graph is wall time per frame **including the idle sleep**, so it sits at the tick interval (about 15 ms at 66 tick) until the server overloads. The useful numbers there are late ticks and the `ngl_bench_limit` stress test, which finds the NPC count where the server can no longer keep its tick rate.
